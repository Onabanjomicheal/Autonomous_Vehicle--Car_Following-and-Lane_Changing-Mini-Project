# Autonomous Vehicle Simulation: Car Following and Lane Changing

## 🛣️ Project Overview
This repository contains the necessary configuration files for simulating an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) environment within **SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)**. The focus of this mini-project is to model and analyze the interactions related to **Car Following** and **Lane Changing** behaviors of autonomous and conventional vehicles.

## 📁 Repository Contents
| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `VehicleType.net.xml` | Defines the road network |
| `VehicleType.netecfg` | Configuration file for NETEDIT, used to edit the road network definition. |
| `VehicleType.rou.xml` | Defines the vehicle types, routes, and traffic demand (how many vehicles enter the network). |
| `VehicleType.sumocfg` | The main SUMO configuration file that ties together the network and route files to run the simulation. |

## 🚀 How to Run the Simulation
To run this project, you must have the **SUMO** software package installed.

1. **Install SUMO:**.
2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Onabanjomicheal/Autonomous_Vehicle--Car_Following-and-Lane_Changing-Mini-Proj](https://github.com/Onabanjomicheal/Autonomous_Vehicle--Car_Following-and-Lane_Changing-Mini-Proj)
